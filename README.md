# Vectro-EULA
These are our base End User License Agreements for our fonts. You may use them as a starting point for your own EULA. We did work with a lawyer to create these documents, however, use these at your own risk. We are not responsible for any liability arising from you using these documents, and we recommend working with a lawyer to help prepare your own EULA.

## Notes
These agreements reflect our opinions and preferences for licensing fonts. Before adopting them, you should read through everything and make edits to reflect your own preferences. In particular, these licenses are structured around the concept of using employee size as the basis for pricing. With a single license, the user gets freedom to use the fonts on desktop, web, app, broadcast, etc, without much limitation, as long as they purchase a license that covers the amount of employees in the company. 

You'll also want to be sure to change obvious things like names and jurisdiction to your own country and state.
